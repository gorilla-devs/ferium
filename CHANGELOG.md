Support for Modrinth and CurseForge modpacks!

**_WARNING_**: The config file has had breaking changes.
Add the following to the top of your config file at `~/.config/ferium/config.json` to migrate it:
```json
"active_modpack": 0,
"modpacks": [],
```

- Build workflow now runs when `Cargo.lock` is changed
- Improve `README.md` and add information about modpack subcommands
- Update clippy lints to be stricter
- Added `modpack` subcommand
  - Added integration tests for these too
- Moved `switch` subcommand to `profile switch`
- Added donation hints after adding a Modrinth mod
  - This is to sort of compensate for the fact that no ad revenue is given to mod authors if you use Ferium
- Downloading now shows the file size rather than the number of mods
  - _The progress bar is a liiiieeeeee_ (at first, but it stabilises later)
- Downloads are now stable for 100> mods
- Downloads now directly write to part files then rename the file to its proper name after downloading is finished. Part files will be deleted if found

## `v3.28.7`
### 12.05.2022

- Added the minor version to all dependencies because `cargo install` doesn't use the lockfile
- Update to Libium 1.14.1

Upgrading and verbose listing of mods is now _**SUPER**_ fast compared to before (14-20 times) due to multi threading

- Added multi threading for getting latest mod versions and downloading mods
- Added `--threads` options to limit the maximum number of additional threads
- Used `Arc` in many locations to use the APIs without having to _actually_ clone them
- Added `mutex_ext` to (somewhat unsafely) recover from a poison error and lock a mutex
- If a CurseForge request fails during version determination with a status code, then the request is tried again
  - Requests are sent so fast the CF API gives 500 internal server errors sometimes

## `v3.27.0`
### 07.05.2022

- Added a `.old` directory in the output directory to store 'deleted' mods

  - Extract internet connection check function
- Created a `check_output_directory()` that uhhh.. checks the output directory
  - If it's not called `mods`, it will output a warning
  - If it contains stuff, it will ask if you want to create a backup
    - So that you don't lose the stuff in there when you upgrade
  - Along with the original relative directory check
- Made sort command convert to lowercase when sorting

## `v3.25.1`

- Updated Libium and Ferinth, to fix 2 issues
- CurseForge mods that have no logo no longer cause errors

 - Getting the primary file of a Modrinth `Version` has been moved to the conversion function
   - A workaround with vectors is being used to avoid a possible borrow checker bug
 - Ferium will now only rely on Fabric backwards compatibility if it can't find a native Quilt version. This fixes [#30](https://github.com/theRookieCoder/ferium/issues/30)

## `v3.23.0`
### 01.05.2022

## [3.21.0] - 20.04.2022

- Removed `no_patch_check` flag for the upgrade command
- There are now overrides for game version and mod loader checks. For now there is no UI, you have to edit the config file manually

## [3.20.1] - 16.04.2022

When picking a file from a version, Ferium will get the primary file rather than the first file

## [3.20.0] - 16.04.2022

- Added a `Downloadable` struct that represents (and be converted from) a mod file from Modrinth, GitHub Releases, or CurseForge
- There is now also a constant for the cross too ("×")
- Big changes to upgrading:
  - Does not empty the output directory
  - Checks if the latest compatible version is already downloaded, if so it does not download it again
  - If there are files that are not the latest compatible version of a mod, then they are deleted. So _effectively_ the output directory is emptied

## [3.19.1] - 03.04.2022

- Added a sort command that sorts mods in alphabetical order
- Edited the `mod.rs` files to make accessing functions better
- Updated some user facing output such as command help pages, and errors

- The makefile targets `install` and `install-dev` now install to Cargo's `bin` directory
- `install-dev` is now the default goal in the makefile
- `save_config.py` and `restore_config.py` have been updated to use pathlib so that paths are cross platform and no long *NIX paths
- Added handing for Ferinth's new error
- The integration tests also don't use hardcoded *NIX paths anymore
- `check_empty_config()` checks for curse_project now, this was a bug fixed by [SolidTux](https://github.com/SolidTux) in [PR #2](https://github.com/theRookieCoder/ferium/pull/2)
- Move Python scripts for testing to `tests/scripts/`

## [3.11.0] - 23.01.2022

### CURSEFORGE SUPPORT!

- Renamed `mod_ids` and `repos` to `modrinth_mods` and `github_repos` in `Profile`
- Added `curse_projects` to `Profile`
- Added `add-curseforge` command
- An API key is required to compile the application. Without this, the program will not compile. You can a provide blank value for this and the program will compile but anything using the CurseForge API will not work

- The remove command no long tries to remove the mod file (to be reintroduced later)
- Added 2 flags to the upgrade command
  - `no_picker` When upgrading GitHub mods, if multiple assets are compatible a picker is normally shown. This option disables this and uses the first one
  - `no_patch_check` Normally, upgrading curse and modrinth mods will check for the full game version, but sometimes mods works between patch versions, so this option skips checking for the patch version. This doesn't affect upgrading GitHub mods
- Made a test for the upgrade command. Will have to implement checking of the mods downloaded later
- Some integration tests have been edited to test curse mods too
- Upgrading GitHub mods now checks the releases' names for the game version too

## [3.10.0] - 16.01.2022

HUGE UPDATE

### Project and Testing
- Upgraded to Clap 3.0
- Removed unit tests
- Added every single sub(sub)command to the integration tests
- The integration tests are now fully automatic because we can now pass options without the interactive UI

### Main
- Getting the config file no longer exits the program early when creating a new config file
- A more helpful error message for when decoding the config file fails
- The `profile create` subcommand now runs seperately before the current profile is read
- Multiple new command have been created such as `list_profiles()`, and `delete()`
- Many commands have been revamped to allow the arguments to be passed through the CLI rather than through a UI
- The `profile configure` command's UI now has an option to change the profile's name

### Arg Parsing
- Removed `cli.yaml` and switched from the deprecated yaml parsing to #[derive] based arg parsing
- Renamed `add`, `add-repo`, and `config` commands to `add-modrinth`, `add-github`, and `configure`
- The `create` and `config` commands are now under a new subcommand `profile`
- `profile delete` and `profile list` subsubcommands have been added
- The following commands have had options added to them so now using the interactive UI is optional. This also allows for fully automatic tests
  - Remove
  - Switch
  - Configure
  - Create
  - Delete

### Error handling
- There are now 2 errors for quitting
  - The `Quit` error stores its error message as a tuple `&'static str` so that raw strings can be used
  - The `QuitFormatted` error stores its error message as a tuple `String` so that `format!()` can be used for more informative error messages

### Configuration (`json.rs`)
- The `mod_loader` field in `Profile` is now an enum
- The `Profile::new()` is now `Profile::create_ui()`
- `create_ui()` now checks that the name provided does not already exist, if so it will ask for a new name
- Getting the path to the config file has been extracted to `get_config_file_path()`
- If `get_config_file()` does not find a config file, it now just creates an empty config, writes to it, and continues to return the config file

## [3.9.0] - 23.12.2021

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

- The previous `Config` is now a `Profile`. The `Profile` has a new field, `name`
- The new `Config` contains a list of profiles and the index of the active profile
- Added a `create` command to create a new profile
- Added a `switch` command to switch between profiles
- A remove command for profiles will be added in the next update
- Switch back to Clap v2 because I'm rewriting the command system in the next update
- Edited makefile to run clippy in `make test` and builds
- Many code changes based on Clippy suggestions

## [3.8.1] - 29.11.2021

- Switched to `octocrab` and removed `octorok`
- Lots of code has been refactored and many comments and docs have been edited and improved
- The name of config file fields have been edited so that they more accurately represent the data they hold. **This breaks previous configs** and requires editing field names to fix
- In the config file, repos are now stored as tuples rather than structs
- Added verbose option to the list command. So now the non-verbose list command gives less information, but is faster
- Improved error handling
- Tweaked semver patch remove function so that it works on semvers other than Minecraft's
- Switched from `fancy-regex` to `onig`
- Added integration tests (**check the readme on how to properly run these**) and some unit tests too. These tests run before makefile builds

- Improved the GitHub Releases version and mod loader checking algorithm
- `download_release()` and `download_version()` are now `download_asset()` and `download_version_file()` repectively
- If multiple compatible assets were found, a selector is shown to let the user pick the latest version
- The progress indicators updates now show the name of the asset being downloaded rather than the name of the `Version` or `Release`

## [3.5.0] - 24.10.2021

### Added

- Build and release workflow
- `config` command

### Changed

- Internet connection timeout
- Improved `remove` command by showing mods and repos at once
- `ferium list` formatting
- `get_config_file` returns `None`, rather than erroring out, after first time setup
- `Select` and `MultiSelect` use the colorful theme
- Switched to Mozilla Public License 2.0
- Functions which change `config` values now don't write to the `config_file`. The main function does so with those functions receiving a `&mut Config` instead
